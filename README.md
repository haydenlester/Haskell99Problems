# Haskell99Problems

### What?
Per the [wiki page](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).
> These are Haskell translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems, which
are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems.

### Why?
I took an interest in functional programming, and how it can make me a
better developer. Multiparadigm languages have grabbed attention as of
late. Many concepts in FP are portable, for example, with Java's
functional interfaces, or the stream API.

So, partly for hobby purposes, and partly because I am sick of side
effects. I expect what I learn here to be helpful in all sorts of
ways, however.

### When?
I am currently working on these problems. They are broken up into
eleven parts.

### Where?
`part1.hs` for part 1, `part2.hs` for part 2, etc.
Information on which problems are in which part can be found on
the wiki page linked at the top of this document.
